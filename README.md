Below is a complete Python code using Pygame that simulates a ball bouncing inside a rotating hexagon.

In this simulation:
The hexagon rotates about its center at a constant angular velocity.
A ball, affected by gravity and a slight air friction, moves inside the hexagon.
When the ball collides with a hexagon wall, the program calculates the collision against the moving (rotating) wall and reflects the ballâ€™s velocity accordingly using the relative velocity of the wall.
You can adjust constants (gravity, restitution, friction, angular speed, etc.) as needed.
